##this file is a project made by me . Got this idea from Brad Traversy (Youtube Creator).Made in JS,HTML and ofcourse CSS.We have also included jquery for a better frontend.Although its a basic project but can be handy in a full stack library management system.We have used the storage class to store the data for the books
